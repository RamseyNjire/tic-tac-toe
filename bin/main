# game is tic-tac-toe
# consists of 2 players
# each player chooses either 'X' or 'O'. We'll call these their letters
# the board consists of a 3x3 grid ie with 9 cells
# game starts with one player (could be random) entering their letter in any of the cells
# The next player then enters their letter and the game continues in alternating fashion
# Objective of the game is to fill in 3 cells in a row with your letter, that is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
# A player can seek to fill in cells to win or to block the other player's move.
# game ends in one of 2 scenarios: One player succeeds at filling 3 cells in a row or all cells are filled and no player wins, that is draw

# Here is the game flow
# Computer displays game board and prompts player to pick a cell in which to enter their letter. Cells are numbered 1-9
# Player 1 is 'X' by default, so computer can pick randomly who player 1 is.
# Once player one chooses a cell, computer displays message saying what player 1 did and asks player 2 to make a move in the same fashion
# At each iteration, the computer checks the state of the board to see if either player has won, if the board no longer has open cells
# At each iteration, the computer could also display the board.
# When game is over, computer displays 'game over' message, indicating who won, or indicating that game is a draw.
# Also, computer should not allow players to enter letters in a cell that is already occupied. or enter a number that is not on board.
# Computer assigns letters to players in a hash

player_one = { symbol: :X }
player_two = { symbol: :O }
current_player = player_one
turns = 4
# Computer asks for player's names

puts 'Enter first player name: '

player_one [:name] = gets.chomp.capitalize

puts "Welcome #{player_one[:name]}. Your symbol will be #{player_one[:symbol]}"

puts 'Enter second player name: '
player_two [:name] = gets.chomp.capitalize

puts "Welcome #{player_two[:name]}. Your symbol will be #{player_two[:symbol]}"

# Computer will display new state of game board (preferably visually)

board = [
  ['', '', ''],
  ['', '', ''],
  ['', '', '']
]

board.each { |array| p array }

# Computer prompts for each player to do their turn. In this example, we've only used one player for simplicity.
# At each turn, the computer will check state of board and determine if there is an error, if one player has won, or if it is a draw.

turns.times do
  puts "#{current_player[:name]}, please choose a cell between 1 and 9 to make your move: "
  move = gets.chomp.to_i
  puts 'Please enter a number between 1 and 9' unless move <= 1 && move <= 9
  puts "You have chosen cell #{move}."
end

# When player wins
puts "#{current_player[:name]} has won. The game is over"

# when game ends in draw
puts 'There are no more empty cells. The game has ended in a draw'
