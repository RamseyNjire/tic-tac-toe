  The game starts with the first  player entering their letter in any of the cells from 1 to 9.

  The next player then enters their letter and the game continues in alternating fashion

  Objective of the game is to fill in 3 cells in a row with your letter, that is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

  Game ends in one of 2 scenarios: One player succeeds at filling 3 cells in a row or all cells are filled and no player wins, that is draw
